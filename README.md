# Express Note Taking Application

## Description

A command line application using node.js and express.js. Allows a user to build a series of note cards and save them to a file . To create this application I used node.js, the npm packages inquirer and jest, and the built in fs package. I made use of async and await to handle promises, and learned a lot about synchronicity in javascript.

See this link to use the deployed application: https://express-note-taker-999845.herokuapp.com/notes
## Usage

If you would like to run this locally, download the files. Then, run the npm i command to install the necessary packages. Then run the command node server.js to open and click the link that appears in the command line to see the deployed app on localhost.
