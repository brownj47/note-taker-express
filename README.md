# Express Note Taking Application

## Description

A command line application using node.js and express.js. Allows a user to build a series of note cards and save them to a file . To create this application I used node.js, the npm packages inquirer and jest, and the built in fs package. I made use of async and await to handle promises, and learned a lot about synchronicity in javascript.
